/*                           Lab 4.1 Data-driven display w/ function
Algo:
    1.) Create an object for a eyes
            -> give properties for x position, y position, radius, color
    2.) use object in draw method to draw what is needed
    3.) move code to draw eeys from draw fucntion into a drawEyes(Eyes) function
    4.) now call the drawEyes() function in the draw function to make it draw eyes based on the Eyes object properties

/*                              Lab 4.2 Reverse Tennis (?)
Algo:
    1.) Create 2 objects
            -> give properties for x position, y position, width, & height
                ->ensure x positions are on opposite sides of eachother
    2.)in draw function, draw both rectangles based on their properties
    3.)use if statment for keyup/down propery
            -> if key up is pressed, rectangle 1's y value increases & rectangle 2's decreases
            -> if key down is pressed, rectangle 1's y value decreases & rectangle 2's increases

/*                             Lab 4.3 Bouncing Ball / World Wrap Refactor
Algo:
    1.) Create an object for the ball
        -> give properties for x position,  y postion, radius, velocity, & color
    2.) Rewrite code while only using values from the ball object
